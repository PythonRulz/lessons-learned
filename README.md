# My Own Path To Python

 I am self taught for the most part, utilizing some youtube tutorials, free classes in UDEMY and Stack Skills and as many free Python books as I can get my hands on.  Most of my code will make zero sense to those who use it professionaly, and probably those who use it as a hobby.  I also have no idea how to use GIT/GITHUB so this is all a new experience for me

 # Stocks Code
 This code came about as I wanted to find a way to have a file emailed to me Monday through Friday to show how my stocks did for the day and the +/- from the previous day total.  It started off simple enough and got out of hand really quick.  
 Much of my purchases are now in fractional shares as dividends re-invest.  Obviously there is a much better way to write this and one day I'll figure it out.  THe program simply goes out at the end of the day and retrieves the last price of a 
 stock, does some math and writes the gain/loss.  After they are all added up, they take the previous days total and subtracts that number to show me the difference via an index.html file.  Very crude, but it does work.  Simply change the tickers
 and your numbers to make it work.
